# LinkedIn Data Analysis Tool

This Python tool analyzes exported LinkedIn data to visualize user activity, network growth, and interactions.  
The code contains comments written in French for personal clarity, while all public documentation is provided in English.

## Features

- Monthly and cumulative activity plots
- Heatmaps and time-of-day analysis
- Saved job insights and professional journey mapping
- Sector breakdown of connections
- GUI interface with progress tracking

## How to Use

1. Export your LinkedIn data from your LinkedIn account settings.
2. Place the CSV files in the `data/` folder.
3. Run the script using:  
   `python linkedin_analyse.py`

## Data Folder

This project expects LinkedIn CSV exports to be placed in the `data/` directory.  
For demonstration purposes, the repository includes anonymized example files that illustrate the expected structure.

(Do not upload personal LinkedIn data to GitHub.  
Use anonymized examples or keep the folder empty.)

## Technologies

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, tkinter)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization
- GUI development

## Academic Context

This project was developed as part of my Master's program in Econometrics (DS2E).  
It demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, visualization, and workflow design using Python.

## Future Improvements

- Add automated dashboards
- Improve GUI design
- Add export options for charts
- Extend analysis to messages and posts
